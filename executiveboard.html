In 2011, she departed Chicago, IL to complete her final two years of high school at the Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa (UWCSA). Her experience in Swaziland invigorated her passion for education and service, and showed her the value of bringing together diverse individuals. At NYU Abu Dhabi, Sofia has served as the Officer of Communications in Student Government and interned with both the Office of Spiritual Life and Intercultural Education and the Office of Community Outreach. In 2015, Sofia received the Dalai Lama Fellowship and co-founded the Girls’ Education Network, a leadership development program for young girls. She has also studied and spent time in Kampala and Accra. In the future, she aims to serve at the intersection of education and equity and explore how meaningful dialogue can serve as a powerful catalyst for individual and community learning. </p>

Developing tools with others that they can use to cultivate their own dreams and aspirations is a rewarding experience. Being a part of CAMA will be another area in which I can truly partner with a great team to reach out to young Africans who may lack the mentorship I was fortunate enough to have as a teenager. As a Zimbabwean, It will also be a way for me to give back to the place that gives me so much joy and taught me the importance of community. In my free time, I enjoy composing poetry and short stories, running and having a good debate about almost anything. I love people, interacting with them, laughing with them and especially learning from them which I think CAMA will enable me to keep doing.</p>

I have a strong passion for programming, and facilitating intercultural communication. I believe the major key to positive change in society is the education of young people. To teach young people to think independently and innovatively, and for them to overcome the differences in each other’s religions, ethnic backgrounds and traditions – these are to be the foundations of change. In 2013, I worked as a facilitator with Lead Us Today, an organization that provides leadership and entrepreneurial training to high school students in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. At NYUAD, I have worked with the Office of Spiritual Life and Intercultural Education as a Sustained Dialogue Ambassador. </p>
